// generate queries for following: 

// 1) Give all irons of the brand Philips or Tefal that cost 30 euros or less, that are red, have a power of 2000 or
// more and have a cord storage space and spray function.

// 2) Give the model, price and brand of the most expensive iron that is not red, weighing less than 2 kilos, that
// has at least 2 plus points, a maximum height of 20 centimeters and that does not have cord storage space as
// extra


// 3) Loop through the irons. Increase the price of all irons with 10%.

// 4) During the sales, each brand gives a specific discount.
// The discounts are given as an object literal
// var discounts = {'Calor': 1, 'Tefal': 5, 'Philips': 3}
// Update all the prices of the irons.
// Note: to traverse the object literal of discounts, you can use the following code
// `for (var key in discounts) { … }`
